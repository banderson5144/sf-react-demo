# React Redux Demo

We will be using two JavaScript libraries in this demo:
React and Redux.

##What is React:
* The “V” in MVC
* React abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and
  better performance.
* Creates the view based on your Data

##What is Redux:
* Awesome
* A predictable state container for JavaScript apps (similar to Flux, Alt, etc.)
  Simple Overview
* The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.
* The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object
  describing what happened.
* To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers.
